## 1. Big Picture Introduction
| Project | Primary Focus | Target Audience | Strengths | Challenges |
|:--------|:--------------|:----------------|:----------|:-----------|
| **eCommerce Microservices App** (like Amazon mini clone) | End-to-end microservices implementation | Backend Developers, Cloud Engineers, DevOps Engineers | Covers real-world requirements, complete system design | Handling distributed systems complexities, eventual consistency |

---

## 2. Project Architecture Overview

- **Modules/Services**
  - **User Service** â†’ Handles Registration, Login, Profile
  - **Product Catalog Service** â†’ CRUD for Products
  - **Order Service** â†’ Place Order, Update Order, Cancel Order
  - **Payment Service** â†’ Payment Processing
  - **Inventory Service** â†’ Stock Management
  - **Notification Service** â†’ Email/SMS on order confirmation
  - **API Gateway** â†’ Single entry point for all client communications
  - **Authentication Service** â†’ JWT token generation, verification
  
- **System Interconnections**

```
Clients (Web / Mobile App)
  â†“
API Gateway
  â†“
Microservices (User / Product / Order / Payment / Inventory)
  â†“
Databases (Each service has independent DB)
  â†“
Message Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ) for asynchronous communication
```

- **Supporting Systems**
  - Centralized Logging (ELK Stack)
  - Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)
  - CI/CD Pipelines for automated deployments

## 3. Skill Map by Levels

| Skill Area | Beginner Topics | Mid-Level Topics | Advanced Topics |
|:-----------|:-----------------|:-----------------|:----------------|
| Service Design | REST APIs, CRUD Services | Bounded Context, Event-driven APIs | Sagas, CQRS, Event Sourcing |
| API Gateway | Basic routing, Authentication pass-through | Rate Limiting, Caching | Custom Authorization policies, Resiliency patterns |
| Database | Separate DB per service (Polyglot Persistence) | Consistency vs Availability | Distributed Transactions handling |
| Communication | Synchronous REST APIs | Asynchronous Messaging (Kafka/RabbitMQ) | Event-driven Architecture best practices |
| Security | Basic JWT authentication | OAuth2 Authorization Server | Zero Trust Security, mTLS between services |
| CI/CD | Manual deployments | GitHub Actions/ GitLab CI for services | Canary Deployments, Blue-Green Deployments |

---

## 4. Important Terms & Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|:-----|:-----------|
| API Gateway | Manages external access, routing requests to services. |
| Service Mesh | Infrastructure layer for service-to-service communication. |
| CQRS | Command Query Responsibility Segregation; separates read and write models. |
| Saga Pattern | A series of local transactions where each transaction triggers the next via event/message. |
| Polyglot Persistence | Using different types of databases for different services. |

âœ…  
**This gives you a very powerful Real-World Teaching Material for Microservices Architecture!**

---

**Coming Up:**  
Would you like me to next build **similar case study blueprints** for:

- Banking App Microservices (Payments, Loans, Cards)?
- Stock Trading App (Place order, Modify, Cancel, Net Positions)?
- Healthcare App (Patient Management, Appointments, Billing)?

ðŸ”¥ These are **very common** in interviews and make superb training modules too!
