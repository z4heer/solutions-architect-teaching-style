## 📚 Big-Picture Driven Teaching Template (Advanced Version)

---

### 🏛️ Big Picture Overview
- **Where Python fits:**  
  Python is a **versatile programming language** used for web development, data science, automation, AI/ML, backend APIs, cloud functions, and more.
- **Connection with Other Systems:**  
  Frontend (Angular/React) ➡️ Backend APIs (Python Flask/Django) ➡️ Database (MySQL, MongoDB) ➡️ Cloud (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions)

- **Typical Architecture Diagram:**
  ```
  [Frontend (React)] → [Backend Python API (Flask/Django)] → [Database] → [Cloud Services]
  ```

### 🔥 Code Snippets

```python
# Example: Simple Python Function
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))
```

```python
# Example: Reading a File
with open('data.txt', 'r') as file:
    data = file.read()
    print(data)
```

```python
# Example: Flask Basic API
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Hello, World!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### 🎯 Best Practices Summary
- Follow PEP8 Coding Style.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Handle exceptions gracefully.
- Modularize code into small functions or classes.
- Document your code using docstrings.

---

### ⚡ Cheat Sheet Summary
| Concept        | Shortcut/Tip |
|----------------|--------------|
| List Comprehension | `[x for x in range(5)]` |
| Dictionary Iteration | `for k, v in dict.items():` |
| Exception Handling | Use `try-except-finally` blocks |
| File Handling | Always use `with open()` syntax |

---

### 🚫 Common Mistakes
- Misunderstanding mutable vs immutable types.
- Forgetting to close file handles (fixed by using `with` block).
- Using global variables unnecessarily.
- Catching broad exceptions (`except Exception:` without specific type).
- Importing unnecessary libraries.

---

> **💡 Teaching Tip:**  
Always reinforce how Python is **the Swiss Army knife of programming**—can be used from **web apps** to **data science** to **cloud automation** — to keep students motivated and connected to real-world applications.
