## 📚 Big-Picture Driven Teaching Template (Advanced Version)
---

### 🏛️ Big Picture Overview
- **Where Java fits:**  
  Java is a **backend enterprise-grade programming language** used for building robust, scalable applications (finance apps, e-commerce platforms, Android apps, cloud services).
- **Connection with Other Systems:**  
  Frontend (Angular/React) ➡️ Backend (Java Spring Boot) ➡️ Database (MySQL, Oracle) ➡️ Cloud (AWS, GCP)

- **Typical Architecture Diagram:**
  ```
  [Frontend UI] → [Backend Java APIs (Spring Boot)] → [Database] → [Cloud Hosting]
  ```

### 🧩 Modular Breakdown
| Module                | Sub-Feature Areas | Real-World Context |
|------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Core Java Basics       | Syntax, Variables, OOP (Class/Object) | Building blocks of any application |
| Collections Framework  | List, Map, Set, Queue | Managing user sessions, processing orders |
| Multithreading         | Threads, Executors | Payment processing, concurrent API handling |
| Stream API             | Functional Operations | Data filtering, processing reports |
| Design Patterns        | Singleton, Factory, Observer | Scalable service design (e.g., Booking Systems) |
| JVM Internals          | Garbage Collection, Memory Model | Optimizing server performance |
| Reflection API         | Dynamic API loading, plugin frameworks | Extensible applications |

### 🧵 Key Technical Words & Definitions
| Term                  | Definition |
|------------------------|------------|
| OOP                    | Object-Oriented Programming - organizing code into reusable objects. |
| Collection             | Framework of classes for data storage and manipulation. |
| Multithreading         | Running multiple threads concurrently for better CPU utilization. |
| Stream API             | Processing sequences of elements with functional-style operations. |
| JVM                    | Java Virtual Machine - engine that runs Java bytecode. |
| Garbage Collection     | Automatic memory management in Java. |
| Reflection             | Ability to inspect and modify runtime behavior of applications. |

### ❓ Common Interview Questions
- What is the difference between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`?
- How does Java achieve platform independence?
- What is a deadlock and how to prevent it?
- Explain Java Memory Model.
- How does Garbage Collection work internally?
- What are common design patterns you have used?

### 🔥 Code Snippets

```java
// Example: Simple Thread Creation
public class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running!");
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        t1.start();
    }
}
```

```java
// Example: Stream API usage
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Jane", "Jack");
List<String> upperCaseNames = names.stream()
                                   .map(String::toUpperCase)
                                   .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

### 🎯 Best Practices Summary
- Always prefer using interfaces (List, Map) over concrete classes (ArrayList, HashMap).
- Avoid creating unnecessary threads manually; use `ExecutorService`.
- Use `Optional` to handle potential `null` values.
- Design loosely coupled code using SOLID principles.

---

### ⚡ Cheat Sheet Summary
| Concept        | Shortcut/Tip |
|----------------|--------------|
| Creating thread | Implement `Runnable` instead of extending `Thread` |
| Iterate List    | Use enhanced `for-each` |
| Stream API      | Prefer `filter`, `map` operations for clean data processing |

---

### 🚫 Common Mistakes
- Forgetting to close resources (use try-with-resources).
- Synchronizing on wrong objects leading to deadlocks.
- Using wrong collection type (e.g., Vector instead of ArrayList).
- Neglecting Exception Handling.
- Memory Leaks due to strong references in collections.

> **💡 Teaching Tip:**  
Always keep linking each technical feature back to **its real-world application** or **architecture usage** to keep the "big picture" alive in the student's mind.
