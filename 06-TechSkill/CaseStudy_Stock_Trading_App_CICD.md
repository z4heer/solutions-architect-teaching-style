### 🏛️ **Big Picture Overview**
A **Stock Trading Application** allows users to place, modify, and cancel stock orders, as well as track net positions and holdings. In this case study, we will examine how to implement a **CI/CD pipeline** for a stock trading application and deploy it on **AWS**. This stock trading app allows users to interact with various stock market features such as order placement, order modifications, and viewing current holdings.

The **CI/CD pipeline** automates code integration, testing, and deployment for all features of the app, including stock order placement, order modifications, cancellations, and portfolio management (net positions, holdings). Implementing CI/CD ensures that the application is consistently updated, stable, and ready for deployment to production at any time.

### 🔥 **CI/CD Stages for Stock Trading App Implementation**

#### 1. **CI/CD Pipeline Design**
- **Version Control Integration:** Stock Trading App uses **GitHub** to store source code.
- **Automated Testing:** **JUnit** and **Mockito** are used for backend tests (order placement, cancellations), and **Jest** is used for frontend (React) testing.
- **Continuous Build & Test:** Every time a change is pushed to **GitHub**, the pipeline is triggered to build and run tests.

#### **Example - GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline Setup for Stock Trading App:**
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline for Stock Trading App

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up JDK
        uses: actions/setup-java@v1
        with:
          java-version: '11'

      - name: Build with Maven
        run: mvn clean install

      - name: Run Unit Tests
        run: mvn test

      - name: Deploy to AWS EC2
        run: |
          ssh -i "aws-key.pem" ec2-user@aws-instance 'cd /path/to/app && ./deploy.sh'
```

#### 2. **Automated Deployment**
- **AWS EC2** is used to deploy the backend of the stock trading app.
- **S3** is used to store frontend build artifacts.
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** is used to handle the deployment of the entire stock trading app.

#### **Example - AWS Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Configuration:**
```json
{
  "ApplicationName": "StockTradingApp",
  "EnvironmentName": "StockTradingApp-prod",
  "VersionLabel": "v1.0.0",
  "SourceBundle": {
    "S3Bucket": "stock-trading-app-bucket",
    "S3Key": "stock-trading-app-v1.0.0.zip"
  }
}
```

#### 3. **Security Measures**
- **OAuth 2.0** and **JWT tokens** are used for user authentication and authorization.
- **AWS KMS (Key Management Service)** is used to encrypt sensitive data such as user credentials and stock holdings.
  
#### 4. **Monitoring and Alerts**
- **Prometheus** and **Grafana** are used for monitoring the system's health, ensuring that orders are processed correctly, and tracking failures in the pipeline.
- **Slack notifications** are used to inform the team if the build or deployment fails.

#### 5. **Real-time Data Integration**
- Real-time stock market data is fetched from **AWS Lambda** functions that interact with **stock data APIs** and process real-time stock prices and orders.

### 🎯 **Best Practices for CI/CD Implementation in Stock Trading App**
- **Automate Deployments:** Use tools like **GitHub Actions** and **AWS CodePipeline** to automate every step from code commit to deployment.
- **Rollback Strategy:** Ensure there are rollback scripts in case a deployment fails (for example, restoring the last working version).
- **Use Docker Containers:** Containerize the app for consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- **Security Best Practices:** Always encrypt sensitive data and use **multi-factor authentication** (MFA) for securing access.
- **Monitoring:** Set up real-time monitoring to track app performance and deployment status.
