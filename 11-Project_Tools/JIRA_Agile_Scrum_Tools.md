## 6. Common Interview/Teaching Questions
- What is the difference between Epic and Story in JIRA?
- How do you estimate tasks using Story Points?
- What are Scrum Ceremonies? Explain each.
- How do you calculate team Velocity?
- How do you automate repetitive tasks in JIRA?

---

## 7. Best Practices
- Keep JIRA boards clean and up-to-date.
- Always create acceptance criteria for Stories.
- Use Automation Rules to manage repetitive work (e.g., auto-assign tasks).
- Conduct effective Sprint Retrospectives to improve continuously.
- Customize Dashboards for better project visibility.

## 8. Cheat Sheet Summary
| Action                 | Shortcut/Tip                   |
|:------------------------|:-------------------------------|
| Create Issue            | "C" in JIRA Dashboard          |
| Search Issues (JQL)     | Use advanced search (/)        |
| Start/Stop Sprint       | Only from Scrum Board           |
| Estimate Story Points   | During Sprint Planning         |
| Run Retrospective       | Conducted immediately after Sprint Review |

---

## 9. Common Mistakes
- Not updating the task status regularly in JIRA.
- Misunderstanding Agile as "no planning needed."
- Not time-boxing meetings properly (Standups, Retros).
- Using JIRA as a documentation tool instead of an Agile Board.
- Over-complicating workflows leading to confusion.
