### 🏛️ Big Picture Overview
- **Where HTML fits:**  
  HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages and web applications. It provides the structure for web content and is often used in combination with **CSS** (for styling) and **JavaScript** (for behavior) to build dynamic, interactive web pages.

- **Connection with Other Systems:**  
  HTML is the foundation of all web development and interacts with various systems like **CSS** (styling), **JavaScript** (dynamic functionality), and backend technologies (for data processing and storage). It plays a crucial role in **frontend development** and is essential when building user interfaces for both **static** and **dynamic web applications**.

- **Typical Architecture Diagram:**
  ```
  [User (Browser)] → [HTML (Content)] → [CSS (Design)] → [JavaScript (Behavior)] → [API (Backend)] → [Database (Storage)]
  ```
